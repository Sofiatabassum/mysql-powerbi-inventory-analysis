MySQL + Power BI Project
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Test Environment Inventory Data to gain insights into product demand, availability, shortages, and financial performance. The dataset was processed in MySQL for data cleaning and preparation, and then visualized in Power BI for business optimization.

The analysis highlights key performance indicators such as:

📊 Average Demand per Day

📊 Average Availability per Day

📊 Total Supply Shortage

💰 Total Profit

💸 Total Loss

📉 Average Daily Loss

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

MySQL → Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing

Power BI → Interactive dashboards and visualization

🚀 Steps Followed

Data Loading → Imported dataset into MySQL database.

Data Cleaning → Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and optimized schema.

Data Preparation → Aggregated metrics for demand, availability, profit, and losses.

Data Visualization → Connected MySQL with Power BI and built insightful dashboards.

Business Insights → Highlighted supply-demand mismatch and financial impact.

🎯 Key Insights

Average demand per day exceeds availability, resulting in supply shortage.

High total loss compared to total profit indicates inefficient supply chain planning.

Monitoring average daily loss helps track recurring inefficiencies.

📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how MySQL and Power BI can work together to transform raw data into meaningful insights, enabling better business optimization and decision-making.
